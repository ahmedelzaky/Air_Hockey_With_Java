# Air Hockey Game

The Air Hockey Game is a simple implementation of the classic air hockey game using JavaFX. It allows two players to compete against each other in a virtual air hockey match.

## Features

<ul>
<li>Two-player mode: Play against a friend on the same computer.
<li>Player movement: Control the player using the arrow keys (Player 1) or W, A, S, D keys (Player 2).
<li>Scoring system: Keep track of each player's score.
<li>Visual effects: Player hits are highlighted with a bloom effect.
</ul>

## Requirements

<ul>
<li>Java Development Kit (JDK) 20 or higher
<li>JavaFX library
</ul>

## How to Run

<ol>

<li>Make sure you have Java and JavaFX installed on your system.
<li>Compile the source code using the following command:

```css
javac --module-path <path_to_javafx_lib> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml Main.java
```

Replace <path_to_javafx_lib> with the path to your JavaFX library.

<li>Run the compiled program using the following command:

```css
java --module-path <path_to_javafx_lib> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml Main
```

Again, replace <path_to_javafx_lib> with the path to your JavaFX library.

</ol>

## How to Play

<ol>
<li>Launch the game.
<li>Player 1 controls:
<ul>
<li>Move up: Up arrow key
<li>Move down: Down arrow key
